\subsection{Perceptual Uncertainty}
An important problem is to formally define the perceptual uncertainty produced by any detection algorithm similar to those in SLAM. For example, if the detector knows the pose estimated have large margins of error, it is useful to have some notion of uncertainty around the estimated pose. These are especially helpful inputs to any motion planing algorithms that takes uncertainty into consideration. In our implementation, we have a loose definition of detection uncertainty. We implicitly treated the pose estimation from depth sensor and RGB sensor as two independent observations. Uncertainty of the pose can be described by the variance and differences between two observations. This can be achieved using a similar technique to the updating step in Kalman filters.
