\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we did a in depth analysis of the localization problem with Apriltags. We proposed a novel algorithm of using RGBD sensors to accurately compute the pose of Apriltags robust to noise. It is particularly suitable for robotic applications which requires precise poses such as manipulation, SLAM, and others. Furthermore, this technique can be easily generalized to other types of planar fiducial tags. Our implementation is fully open sourced and available at:
