% An important extension of the purposed method is to formally define the perceptual uncertainty produced by the pose estimation algorithm. For example, if the detector knows the pose estimated have large margins of error, it is useful to have some notion of uncertainty around the estimated pose. This is especially helpful inputs to any motion planing algorithms that takes uncertainty into consideration.

In this paper, we did a in depth analysis of the localization problem with Apriltags. We proposed a novel algorithm of using RGBD sensors to accurately compute the pose of Apriltags robust to noise. It is particularly suitable for robotic applications which requires precise poses such as manipulation, SLAM, and others. Furthermore, this technique can be easily generalized to other types of planar fiducial tags. Our implementation is fully open sourced and available at:
